"""Parse File/URL content to Bronze records (#498), a batch at a time (#622).

File upload and URL fetch obtain content differently, but rules for converting it to
records must be identical. Same parsing result regardless of source.

Supported formats are CSV/JSON/JSONL/Parquet (#498 P0 scope). Excel/ZIP out of scope
loader/validator already rejects those values.

Content is read as a stream and records come out in batches, so a file larger than
memory is never held whole — not as bytes, not as text, not as a record list:

- **JSONL** is read line by line.
- **JSON** (a top-level array of objects) is read element by element. A malformed
  element is refused where it is found, and one element may span at most
  :data:`MAX_JSON_ELEMENT_CHARS` characters (#920).
- **CSV** is decoded to UTF-8 into a spill file, then read in batches by Polars. The
  column types are still inferred from the whole file (``infer_schema_length=None``),
  so a batch never decides a type the next batch contradicts.
- **Parquet** is spilled to a file and read in batches.

:func:`parse_tabular_bytes` remains for callers holding small content in memory; it
gives the same records the stream gives.
