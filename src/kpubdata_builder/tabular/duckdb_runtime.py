"""Creating and closing DuckDB connections for Builder (ADR 0021, #866).

Nothing in the build or query path uses DuckDB yet: this is the foundation the later
steps (#868 Silver, #869 Gold, #874 query sandbox) build on, so that every connection
Builder opens is made the same way.

- **One connection per unit of work.** A build opens one per source worker; nothing is
  shared, so one worker's tables, settings and temp files cannot reach another's.
- **Settings fixed at open.** ``memory_limit``, ``threads``, ``temp_directory`` and
  ``max_temp_directory_size`` come from a :class:`BuildProfile`; ``TimeZone`` is always
  UTC, whatever the host says (DuckDB otherwise follows the host, which on a Korean
  server is ``Asia/Seoul``). Extensions are never installed or loaded on demand: a
  query must not make the server download code.
- **A temp directory of its own.** Spill files go under
  ``<run>/_duckdb_tmp/<source>-<worker>/``, created at open and removed at close. A
  connection removes only its own directory, so a worker that finishes early does not
  pull the floor out from under one still spilling.

The connection object stays inside the tabular layer. Callers outside it name tables
with :class:`TabularRelation`, which is deliberately not exported from the package root.
