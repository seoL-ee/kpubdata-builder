"""The one way Builder writes SQL for DuckDB (ADR 0021, #866).

Generated SQL mixes two kinds of input, and each has exactly one path in:

- **Identifiers** (column and relation names, which come from provider data and user
  specs) go through :func:`quote_identifier`. Nothing else quotes an identifier.
- **Values** never enter SQL text. They are bound as parameters: a :class:`Statement`
  carries its SQL and its parameters apart, and :func:`execute` hands both to DuckDB.

A value passed through :func:`quote_identifier` would still be a working query, just a
wrong one, so the rule is by convention and review, not by type: identifiers here,
values as parameters.
