"""Builder service logic (#36).

Exposes validate/preview/build/artifacts operations as pure logic independent
of HTTP transport, so external UI like Studio can call Builder directly. Each
method returns a ServiceResponse (status code + JSON-serializable body), and
dispatch routes (method, path) to the corresponding operation.

Major components:
    - ServiceResponse: status code + body
    - BuilderService: validate/preview/build/artifacts operations
    - dispatch: path routing

# 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0: Added Dataset Catalog·Detail·Stage Summary API (#488, additive).
# 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0: Structured Quality/Schema Drift results, quality history/detail
# API added (#486, additive — existing endpoints unchanged).
# 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0: Added query startup/engine timing fields (#523, additive).
# 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0: POST /preview adds Source↔Silver diff and sample_mode
# (first/random) option (#497, additive — existing fields retained). Added limit
# cap (1000) is behavioral tightening (previously no limit) — higher values fail 400.
# 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0: Added GET /monitoring/summary, GET /monitoring/builds (#516,
# additive — existing endpoints unchanged). Async build queue/worker reflect
# read-only snapshot of existing AsyncBuildExecutor/AsyncBuildJobRegistry
# (#511/#513); in normal runtime availability=available.
# MonitoringSummaryResponse.status (healthy/degraded) is deterministic aggregate
# from required subsystem availability (latency threshold unused).
# 1.11.0 -> 1.12.0: Added BuildSpec.composition (JoinSpec) and composition key
# in POST /build response, manifest.composition (CompositionProvenance) (#506,
# additive — existing fields/endpoints unchanged).
# 1.12.0 -> 1.13.0: Added kind="file"/"url" to BuildSpec sources (existing
# provider/dataset sources interpreted as kind="public_api" additively), POST
# /uploads, GET /uploads/{upload_id}, DELETE /uploads/{upload_id} (#498,
# additive — existing endpoints/sources without kind unchanged). url source in
# P0 scope (GET, Auth=None, https only) defended by safe fetch against SSRF.
# 1.13.0 -> 1.14.0: Added GET /builds/{run_id}/events (#496, additive — existing
# endpoints unchanged). raw logger parsing not needed to query structured event
# append-only timeline for run/source fetch/medallion stage (bronze/silver/gold/
# export)/quality checkpoint. limit/tail query parameter bounded (default 200,
# cap 1000), always chronological ascending. Monitoring (#516) system aggregate
# separate role — this endpoint handles single run events only.
# 1.14.0 -> 1.15.0: Added discovery metadata (description/tags/source_url/
# representation/operations/query_support) to /catalog response (CatalogDataset)
# (#490, additive — existing fields retained, raw_metadata not exposed).
# 1.15.0 -> 1.16.0: Documented async build job surface in contract — POST
# /builds (202/200 idempotent/409/429) and GET /builds/{run_id} (job status
# polling) added (#480). Job status query applies ownership gate to block
# cross-owner build output exposure (behavioral tightening — previously unchecked).
# 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0: Added build publish surface (#491) — GET /builds/{run_id}/
# publish/readiness and POST /builds/{run_id}/publish (idempotent receipt, TOCTOU
# recheck).
# 1.17.0 -> 1.18.0: Added POST /builds/{run_id}/cancel (#481, ADR 0008 —
# additive). queued job cancelled immediately before execution; running job
# transitions through cancelling to cancelled at safe stage boundary (no forceful
# termination). BuildJobStatus vocabulary (queued/running/cancelling/succeeded/
# failed/cancelled) reused. Also additive: status/partial (partial artifacts flag)
# in BuildManifest, run_cancelled in BuildEventName, cancelled in BuildSummary
# .status enum (value already observed in BuildIndex/dataset contract, now
# actually observable).
# 1.18.0 -> 1.19.0: Added publish receipt operations path (#551, additive) —
# GET /builds/{run_id}/publish/receipt (query unknown state), POST
# /builds/{run_id}/publish/reconcile (check remote, confirm succeeded or reset
# for republish), DELETE /builds/{run_id}/publish/receipt (explicit reset, audit
# log). reconcile returns 503 without changes if remote unreachable.
# 1.19.0 -> 1.20.0: Added kaggle and local to HTTP publish targets (#550,
# additive). kaggle only when packaging dataset-metadata.json id matches
# destination (readiness blocker validation), local restricted to relative
# owner/name paths under KPUBDATA_BUILDER_LOCAL_PUBLISH_ROOT. GET readiness
# destination query parameter optional.
# 1.20.0 -> 1.21.0: Added publish audit log query (#563, additive) —
# GET /builds/{run_id}/publish/audit (reconcile/reset history, ownership gate).
# 1.21.0 -> 1.22.0: Studio Home dashboard reads authoritative aggregate without
# arbitrary numeric synthesis — two additive queries added (existing fields/
# behavior immutable):
#   - Total in GET /datasets response — distinct dataset count after canonical
#     grouping + ownership filter, before pagination (limit). Do not confuse
#     items.length/limit with total.
#   - GET /quality/summary?window=24h — summarize structured quality from
#     accessible runs in recent 24h as PASS/WARN/FAIL run counts (#486 domain
#     quality bounded cross-run aggregate). Keep separate from system
#     observability (/monitoring).
#   - Added request_parameters and application to CatalogDataset in GET /catalog
#     response (same unmerged release scope additive — existing fields/behavior
#     immutable). Serialized from raw_metadata request_parameters as secret-free
#     allowlist (name/required/description/example); secret parameters like
#     serviceKey excluded. Add Data uses selected Dataset's required request
#     parameters for early user guidance. Datasets without metadata yield empty
#     array. application is guidance when API Key issuance separate from
#     per-Dataset approval ({required, url}); null if absent from raw_metadata
#     (Builder/Studio not guessing approval status).
# 1.22.0 -> 1.23.0: Added rename and derived to BuildSpec sources[].schema
# (SchemaContract) (#611, additive — existing fields/behavior immutable). rename
# maps original field name → canonical column (applied before casting), derived
# creates new columns with date_parts/join_key typed rules (applied after
# casting). Hand-written YAML declarations now exposed in public contract so
# Studio and type generator can discover/type them.
# 1.23.0 -> 1.24.0: Added read_as and null_tokens to SchemaContract (#613,
# additive — existing fields/behavior immutable). read_as declares source columns
# with per-record type variation (CSV parsing applies at stage, preserving leading
# zeros), null_tokens collects source null representations before casting.
# 1.24.0 -> 1.25.0: Added coalesce and zfill to SchemaContract (#620, additive
# — existing fields/behavior immutable). coalesce gathers per-generation alias
# columns into one canonical column (overlapping groups rejected — result order
# differs per declaration), zfill left-pads canonical identifiers to declared
# width with zeros. casts dtype vocabulary adds year_month.
# 1.25.0 -> 1.26.0: Added column_null_tokens to SchemaContract (#623, additive
# — existing fields/behavior immutable). Declare source null representations
# varying per column without changing other columns' meaning. Null tokens
# accepted per column: global null_tokens + that column's declaration; per-column
# declaration does not override global.
# 1.27.0 -> 1.28.0: Added admin-only GET /admin/runs and GET /admin/config
# no artifact bytes or credentials.
# 1.26.0 -> 1.27.0: Added param_grid to SourceRef (#613, additive — existing
# fields/behavior immutable). One source calls multiple parameter combinations
# repeatedly, concatenating results into one dataset. Expansion order is contract
# (by key name, last key fastest, declaration order within axes) — order changes
# break Bronze bytes, breaking rebuild determinism.
# 1.29.0 -> 1.30.0: column metadata gains logical_type and wire_encoding (#735,
#   additive) on /query (column_meta), /preview schema items and SilverColumnInfo.
#   Decimal columns and integer columns holding a value outside ±(2**53 - 1) are sent
#   as exact decimal text, because a JSON number is read as a double.
# 1.30.0 -> 1.31.0: GET /datasets/{dataset_id}/runs/{run_id} (studio#418, additive).
#   One run by id, not only the newest page; 404 when it is not the dataset's, 403
#   when it is but not the caller's.
# 1.31.0 -> 1.32.0: JoinSpec gains keys, cardinality and on_null_key; the manifest's
#   CompositionProvenance gains optional cardinality and ratio fields (#698, additive).
#   duplicate_key_warning is judged on keys present on both sides only.
# 1.32.0 -> 1.33.0: BuildSpec gains license_name and license_link, and publishes the
#   attribution it already accepted (#764, additive). `license: other` needs both.
# 1.36.0 -> 1.37.0: POST /build may answer 409 with warehouse_failures when a table commit
#   failed after every source built (#787, #788, additive).
# 1.37.0 -> 1.38.0: GET /warehouse/tables, GET /warehouse/tables/{name} and
#   POST /warehouse/query read committed table snapshots, the last one pinning the
#   snapshot for the query's lifetime (#797, additive).
# 1.38.0 -> 1.39.0: /analyses saves a query bound to the snapshot id it read, holds that
#   snapshot, and re-runs against it (#783, additive).
# 1.39.0 -> 1.40.0: CatalogDataset gains quota, the spec licence's rate limit verbatim or
#   null (#778, additive).
# 1.40.0 -> 1.41.0: column metadata gains optional semantic, display and unit hints, each
#   with its origin (#813, additive; ADR 0019). Metadata only; absent when undescribed.
# 1.41.0 -> 1.42.0: manifest provenance gains fetched_row_count, source_reported_total and
#   coverage; WarehouseSnapshot gains coverage (#816, additive). Totals are never summed.
# 1.42.0 -> 1.43.0: POST /warehouse/rows reads one page of a pinned snapshot with a stable
#   order, filters, a column selection and a count with its status (#815, additive).
# 1.43.0 -> 1.44.0: POST /warehouse/aggregate runs named aggregates over a pinned snapshot,
#   top N after the whole aggregate, mixed units refused or split (#818, additive).
# 1.44.0 -> 1.45.0: /warehouse/exports writes a pinned query's full result as a bundle with
#   its manifest and terms, checked by licence and PII policy (#819, additive).
# 1.45.0 -> 1.46.0: GET /warehouse/tables/{name}/profile describes a snapshot's columns —
#   nulls, NaN/infinite counts, value ranges — withholding suspected PII columns and
#   small groups (#817, additive).
# 1.46.0 -> 1.47.0: WarehouseTable in GET /warehouse/tables gains current_snapshot and
#   dataset_id (#841, additive).
# 1.47.0 -> 1.48.0: BuildSummary gains dataset_id, dataset_title, snapshot_id and snapshots,
#   and GET /builds takes ?dataset_id= (#844, additive).
# 1.48.0 -> 1.49.0: GET /quality/issues lists warn/fail checks and schema drift across the
#   caller's tables with filters, a cursor and evaluation coverage (#843, additive).
# 1.49.0 -> 1.50.0: provider tests call a dataset chosen by declared parameters or answer
#   not_testable, and GET /providers reports each provider's last_test (#842).
# 1.50.0 -> 1.51.0: in a multi-user deployment another owner's run answers 404 on every run
#   route, like a missing run (#796, behaviour only).
# 1.51.0 -> 1.52.0: GET /admin/runs gives each run's failure reason (#679, additive).
# 1.52.0 -> 1.53.0: POST /build gains `materialized` when the deployment has a
#   warehouse — committed table snapshots per source (#703, additive). Absent, not
#   empty, when no warehouse is configured: an empty object would claim nothing was
#   committed, which a caller cannot tell from never having asked.
# (#679, additive — existing paths·behavior unchanged). Both return metadata only,
# 1.53.0 -> 1.54.0: the Builder sign-up ledger — /admin/users and approve/reject, and 403
#   signup_pending/signup_rejected for OIDC users not admitted (#785, additive).
# 1.54.0 -> 1.55.0: SourceRef gains gold (select/filters) and the manifest gold_selection
#   (#659, additive).
#   additive).
# 1.55.0 -> 1.56.0: provider keys by X-Provider-Key header for the request or job only, in a
#   multi-user deployment (#683, behaviour and a header).
#   additive).
# 1.56.0 -> 1.57.0: BuildSpec refresh_cadence and status_axes.health healthy/stale from it (#781,
# 1.57.0 -> 1.58.0: param_grid checkpoint resume and the manifest reproducibility mark (#648,
# 1.58.0 -> 1.59.0: /revisions — immutable document revisions with concurrency checks, revert
#   and an audit trail (#820, additive).
# 1.59.0 -> 1.60.0: versioned checksums — SourceProvenance.data_checksum_algorithm, the
#   manifest's inputs_fingerprint_algorithm and per-Gold artifacts {artifact_digest,
#   artifact_writer} (#867, additive; new runs' data_checksum values change algorithm).
# 1.60.0 -> 1.61.0: kpubdata code columns stored as text are reported as logical_type
#   identifier (wire_encoding always string) on query/preview/warehouse column metadata,
#   with the spec's semantic/display hints (#702, additive).
# 1.51.0 -> 1.52.0: preview/build/builds answer 403 url_source_forbidden for a url source in a
#   multi-user deployment, and declare the existing provider_credential_required (#685).
# 1.35.0 -> 1.36.0: DatasetSummary / DatasetDetailResponse gain status_axes — refresh,
#   completeness, health, access, maturity as separate fields (#781, additive).
# 1.34.0 -> 1.35.0: GET /version also reports the application version (#777, additive).
# 1.33.0 -> 1.34.0: the source_fetch_progress build event, one per finished param_grid
#   combination with metrics {done, total} (#648, additive).
# 1.61.0 -> 1.62.0: declared PII columns masked in Gold by default; SourceRef.gold gains
#   pii_columns and publish_unmasked, the manifest pii_masking (#689, additive).
# 1.62.0 -> 1.63.0: profiles get their own timeout and remember it per snapshot; nan_count/
#   infinite_count minimum 0; categorical/enum/list PII value checks (#896, #897).
# 1.63.0 -> 1.64.0: the pii scan gate counts declared columns Gold masks as handled;
#   manifest pii_masking gains declared_absent and masked[].masked_as, and a non-text
#   masked column keeps its dtype as null (#902, additive).
# 1.64.0 -> 1.65.0: redistribution terms (#688) — publish readiness reports and enforces
#   each source's verdict (option confirm_non_commercial), and data whose terms are
#   forbidden answers 403 redistribution_forbidden on every way out (additive).
# 1.65.0 -> 1.67.0 (1.66.0 is held by the open #923): publish tokens by the
#   X-Publish-Credential header for the request only in a multi-user deployment; no
#   stored publish credential and no server HF_TOKEN/KAGGLE_* fallback there (#925,
#   behaviour and a header).
# 1.67.0 -> 1.68.0: declared PII stays masked on Silver and Bronze reads (#900) — /query on
#   Silver, /preview and the Silver stage sample mask it (masked_columns), and a Bronze or
#   Silver artifact file of a source with declared PII answers 403 declared_pii_withheld;
#   an unreadable declaration fails closed with 503 pii_declaration_unavailable and
#   sample_withheld: pii_declaration_unavailable (additive).
# 1.68.0 -> 1.69.0: GET /version reports publish_credential — request, stored or
#   stored_or_server — so a client knows where this deployment takes publish
#   credentials from (#938, additive).
# 1.69.0 -> 1.70.0: the manifest's split_algorithm — ratio splits are hash-sort-v2 (#871,
#   additive; membership differs from shuffle-v1 for the same seed).
# 1.70.0 -> 1.71.0: dataset cards (#694) — card.json beside README.md, and publish
#   readiness blockers card_missing / card_incomplete (additive).
