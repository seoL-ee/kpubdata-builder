"""Medallion pipeline orchestrator (#48).

Execute each source in BuildSpec in Bronze → Silver → Gold order,
persist each stage's outputs in the execution workspace, and record
the build manifest.

Partial success policy (BUILD_STATE.md): If any source fails,
the overall status is recorded as failed, but successful sources'
outputs and failure information are preserved in the manifest.

If BuildSpec.composition exists (#506), after all sources complete
Bronze/Silver/Gold, composition joins the validated Silver layers
of its two referenced sources to create a separate combined Gold
dataset (gold/{composition.name}/). Existing independent Gold per
source is preserved — composition is additive, not a replacement.

Key components:
    - SourceBuildOutcome: per-source execution result
    - CompositionOutcome: composition (join) execution result (#506)
    - BuildResult: overall execution result
    - run_build: pipeline entry point
