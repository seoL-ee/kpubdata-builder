"""Gold stage package (#47).

Exposes Gold stage implementation that makes Silver refined tables into export-ready
packages (GoldPackage).

Main components:
    - GoldPackage / ExportPlan: output and export plan models
    - build_gold_package: SilverDataset → GoldPackage
    - persist_gold_package: persist Gold output
    - DatasetCard / build_dataset_card / render_dataset_card: dataset card (#37)
