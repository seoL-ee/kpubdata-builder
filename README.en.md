# KPubData Builder

**KPubData Builder is a reproducible dataset build and warehouse layer built on KPubData.**

> The KPubData family: [KPubData](https://github.com/yeongseon/kpubdata) is a standalone public-data access SDK, **KPubData Builder** is a downstream consumer of its public API, and [KPubData Studio](https://github.com/yeongseon/kpubdata-studio) is a visual workspace for Builder. Dependencies run one way: Studio → Builder → KPubData. The repository, the Python package and the CLI are named `kpubdata-builder`.

It sits atop [kpubdata](https://github.com/yeongseon/kpubdata) and runs a Medallion pipeline: Bronze (raw) → Silver (typed/normalized) → Gold (exportable). BuildSpec is the declarative contract that ensures reproducibility — the same spec produces the same output.

[**📘 한국어**](./README.md)

## Why it exists

Fetching public data alone is not enough. Real dataset work requires:

- **Spec-driven reproducibility**: the same BuildSpec produces the same output every time
- **Staged transparency**: Bronze (raw) → Silver (normalized) → Gold (export-ready) progression
- **Build-publish separation**: generating files and pushing to external stores are distinct, gated steps
- **Audit trail**: Manifest records spec digest, status, and artifact metadata

## Install

```bash
pip install kpubdata-builder
```

Or Docker:

```bash
docker build -t kpubdata-builder:latest .
docker run --rm -e KPUBDATA_BUILDER_API_KEY="${API_KEY}" kpubdata-builder:latest
```

## Quick start

### Minimal BuildSpec

```yaml
dataset_id: weather-forecast
title: Weather Forecast Dataset
sources:
  - provider: datago
    dataset: village_fcst
    params:
      base_date: "20250401"
      nx: 55
      ny: 127
exports:
  - kind: markdown
    output_path: artifacts/report.md
```

### CLI commands

```bash
# Validate
kpubdata-builder validate specs/weather.yaml

# Preview (schema + samples, no execution)
kpubdata-builder preview specs/weather.yaml --limit 5

# Build
kpubdata-builder build specs/weather.yaml --output-dir ./dist

# Publish results
kpubdata-builder publish specs/weather.yaml \
  --target huggingface \
  --destination my-org/my-dataset \
  --artifacts-dir ./dist/run-001

# HTTP service (for Studio integration)
kpubdata-builder serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Medallion Architecture

The pipeline runs through three stages:

- **Bronze**: fetch raw data via kpubdata; preserve source snapshots byte-for-byte
- **Silver**: normalize and validate; compute statistics (the tabular engine is DuckDB — [ADR 0021](https://github.com/yeongseon/kpubdata-builder/blob/main/docs/adrs/0021-duckdb-tabular-engine.md))
- **Gold**: compose Silver output into split-ready, export-ready packages

Execution artifacts are organized as:

```
build/{run_id}/
├── bronze/       # raw API responses
├── silver/       # typed, normalized tables
└── gold/         # export-ready packages
```
